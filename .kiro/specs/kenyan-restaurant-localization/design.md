# Design Document

## Overview

The Kenyan Restaurant Localization project will transform the existing Feane restaurant template into a culturally appropriate and locally relevant website for Kenyan restaurants. This involves systematic content replacement, price conversion, and cultural adaptation while maintaining the existing visual design and functionality.

## Architecture

The localization will follow a content-first approach, updating HTML files directly with new text content while preserving the existing CSS styling and JavaScript functionality. The architecture remains the same:

- **Frontend Structure**: HTML pages with Bootstrap styling
- **Content Layer**: Localized text, prices, and cultural references
- **Styling Layer**: Existing CSS with potential minor adjustments for longer Kenyan text
- **Functionality Layer**: Existing JavaScript functionality preserved
